Verilog-Snake
=============

This is a rudimentary version of Snake (it only has collision detection and movement, but no food generation or snake extension).


The VGA and PS2 controllers were written from scratch. The actual game is more of a showcase for said controlers.

Some of the older Verilog modules are in dire need of refactoring (the seven segment display module especially)
